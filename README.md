# Introduction to Computational Psychiatry

This repostiroy contains materials presented in computational psychiatry group study **@Seoul National University College of Medicine**.

Though computational Psychiatry itself can be divided into many different streams, majority of studies are based on reinforcement learning and Bayesian brain hypothesis. We therefore focus mainly on these two topics.

Please note these materials were used simply to enhance our understanding, thus **might contain some errors**. Most materials are based on *Computational Psychiatry - Mathematical Modeling of Mental Illness* (2018).
